This archive contains files associated with the manuscript referenced above for data storage. Within
it are the following folders, each of which contains a README.txt file describing the files in that
folder. The same applies to any subfolders found within.

/analysis
  
  All files used to collect the raw data generated by the model, data analysis scripts including
  the code used to generate the various data figures in the manuscript.

/data

  Primary data as mined from literature, as well as secondary data for the simulations. Primary data
  for simulations are not included as these can be generated newly using the source code + job files
  and these files taking up a large amount of memory (100s of GBs). The same applies to the 
  secondary data in principle, but these datasets are much smaller (<50 MB) and are mainly included
  for easy validation if necessary.

/images

  Contains all images for the manuscript.

/manuscript

  Contains a copy of the manuscript

/source_code

  Contains the source code for the model, source code for a small program that generates unique 
  parameter files, source code for specific instances of the model, and the job files used to run all 
  the simulations.
