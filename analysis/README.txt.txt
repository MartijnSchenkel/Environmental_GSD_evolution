/2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_data_collection.R
  
  Used to collect the data for the simulations in which Y-chromosomal effects are included. Data set
  is used to determine dynamics of FI, YM and AM alleles as well as when Musca domestica-like 
  systems evolved. Generates a file 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_geno_freqs_0_9999.txt containing the genotype
  data for simulations 0 through 9999. This data set is used for figures 3 and 5.


/2020_05_25_threshold_data_collection.R
  
  Used to collect the data for the simulations in which the effects of the feminization threshold
  theta_F and the overexpression rate 1 + beta_T are investigated. Data set is used to determine 
  dynamics of FI alleles. Generates a file 2020_05_25_threshold_geno_freqs_0_9999.txt containing the 
  genotype data for simulations 0 through 9999. This data set is used for figure 2A.

/2022_02_10_SAY_WYY_analysis_graphics.R

  Used to analyze the datafile ../data/2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_geno_freqs_0_9999.txt generated by the 
  script 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_data_collection. Used to generate Figures 5 and 7. Additionally 
  generates several .rds files which contain the model fit information for the various GAMs which
  can be read in by the script to prevent re-fitting these GAMs, and a file 
  2020_05_11_predictions.txt which contains the predicted allele frequencies based on these GAMs. 
  Both fitting GAMs and making these predictions can be quite time-consuming especially on low-end
  machines. When the script has been run before, these files can be read in by running lines 83-88
  instead of lines 44-72 (read in GAM info) or line 116 instead of lines 103-115 (read in 
  predictions). Finally, this file gnerates several figures in both PDF and PNG format as follows:

  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_allele_frequencies_v2022_02_10.pdf
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_allele_frequencies_v2022_02_10.png
  
    Figure 3.
  
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_Musca_evolution_v2022_02_10.pdf
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_Musca_evolution_v2022_02_10.png

    Figure 5.

  GAM files
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_AM_GAM0.rds - GAM for AM frequency in first deme
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_AM_GAM1.rds - GAM for AM frequency in last deme
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_FI_GAM0.rds - GAM for FI frequency in first deme
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_FI_GAM1.rds - GAM for FI frequency in last deme
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_YM_GAM0.rds - GAM for YM frequency in first deme
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_YM_GAM1.rds - GAM for YM frequency in last deme
 
/2022_02_10_threshold_analysis_graphics.R

  Similar to above, but for the threshold versus beta_T analysis in Figure 4. Reads in a datafile
  ../data/2020_05_25_threshold_geno_freqs_0_9999.txt. Again, several .rds files are generated with
  the GAM fits which are generated in lines 48-56, and can be loaded in lines 63-64 to skip this 
  process once performed (2020_05_25_threshold_FI_GAM0.rds and 2020_05_25_threshold_FI_GAM1.rds). 
  Model predictions are not stored separately and must be re-run, which is much faster for this 
  particular analysis than the one above.

/2022_02_10_threshold_timelapse_data_collection.R

  Used to generate the time series data in Figure 2. Concatenates data from a simulation where output 
  is generated every 10 generations (based on source code in ../source_code/figure_2/).

  Generates secondary data files 2021_06_22_thresholds_2021_07_08_07_48_58_allele_freqs.txt and 
  2021_06_22_thresholds_2021_07_08_07_48_58_geno_freq.txt. 

/2021_07_13_threshold_exploration_data_collection.R

  Similar to 2021_06_15_threshold_analysis_graphics.R above, but for the threshold theta_F versus 
  theta_M analysis in Table 1 and Figure 3. Reads in a datafile 
  ../data/2021_07_13_thresholds_geno_freqs_0_9999.txt. Table data are generated in line 226.

/2021_11_22_Figure_5_geographic_comparison_script.R

  Used to re-analyze data from:

    Kozielska M, Feldmeyer B, Pen I, Weissing FJ & Beukeboom LW (2008). Are autosomal sex-
    determining factors of the housefly (Musca domestica) spreading North? Genet. Res. Cambridge 
    90:157-165.

  Used to generate Figure 5 of the manuscript.  Reads in the following data files:

  ../data/2020_06_12_13_23_16_geno.txt (line 38)
  ../data/2020_06_12_13_23_16_parameter_values.txt (line 39) 
  ../data/2020_06_15_Kozielska_et_al_data.xlsx (line 80)
