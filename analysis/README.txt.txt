/2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_data_collection.R
  
  Used to collect the data for the simulations in which Y-chromosomal effects are included. Data set
  is used to determine dynamics of FI, YM and AM alleles as well as when Musca domestica-like 
  systems evolved. Generates a file 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_geno_freqs_0_9999.txt containing the genotype
  data for simulations 0 through 9999. This data set is used for figures 4 and 6.


/2020_05_25_threshold_data_collection.R
  
  Used to collect the data for the simulations in which the effects of the feminization threshold
  theta_F and the overexpression rate 1 + beta_T are investigated. Data set is used to determine 
  dynamics of FI alleles. Generates a file 2020_05_25_threshold_geno_freqs_0_9999.txt containing the 
  genotype data for simulations 0 through 9999. This data set is used for figure 3A.

/2021_06_15_SAY_WYY_analysis_graphics.R

  Used to analyze the datafile ../data/2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_geno_freqs_0_9999.txt generated by the 
  script 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_data_collection. Used to generate Figures 4 and 6. Additionally 
  generates several .rds files which contain the model fit information for the various GAMs which
  can be read in by the script to prevent re-fitting these GAMs, and a file 
  2020_05_11_predictions.txt which contains the predicted allele frequencies based on these GAMs. 
  Both fitting GAMs and making these predictions can be quite time-consuming especially on low-end
  machines. When the script has been run before, these files can be read in by running lines 83-88
  instead of lines 44-72 (read in GAM info) or line 116 instead of lines 103-115 (read in 
  predictions). Finally, this file gnerates several figures in both PDF and PNG format as follows:

  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_allele_frequencies_v2020_08_12.png
  
    Figure 4.
  
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_Musca_evolution_v2020_08_12.pdf
  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_Musca_evolution_v2020_08_12.png

    Figure 6.

  * 2020_05_11_SAY_WYY_Musca_evolution_v2020_08_12_wide.png

    Figure 6, wide version for e.g. presentations. Not used in manuscript.


/2021_06_15_threshold_analysis_graphics.R

  Similar to above, but for the threshold versus beta_T analysis in Figure 3. Reads in a datafile
  ../data/2020_05_25_threshold_geno_freqs_0_9999.txt. Again, several .rds files are generated with
  the GAM fits which are generated in lines 48-56, and can be loaded in lines 63-64 to skip this 
  process once performed. Model predictions are not stored separately and must be re-run, which is
  much faster for this particular analysis than the one above.

/2020_11_13_Figure_5_geographic_comparison_script.R

  Used to re-analyze data from:

    Kozielska M, Feldmeyer B, Pen I, Weissing FJ & Beukeboom LW (2008). Are autosomal sex-
    determining factors of the housefly (Musca domestica) spreading North? Genet. Res. Cambridge 
    90:157-165.

  Used to generate Figure 5 of the manuscript.  Reads in the following data files:

  ../data/2020_06_12_13_23_16_geno.txt (line 38)
  ../data/2020_06_12_13_23_16_parameter_values.txt (line 39) 
  ../data/2020_06_15_Kozielska_et_al_data.xlsx (line 80)
  
  Note that the files read in lines 38-39 are read by selecting the first files that contain the
  string "geno.txt" and "values.txt" respectively in a folder 2020_06_12_HOTSEX/2020_06_12_HOTSEX/.
